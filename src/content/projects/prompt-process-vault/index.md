# Prompt & Process Vault

A personal productivity system designed to organize and manage the scattered knowledge that accumulates during daily work - prompts, visual assets, and process frameworks.

## The Problem

As someone working extensively with AI tools, I found myself constantly:
- Losing track of effective prompts I had crafted
- Saving screenshots and images without proper organization
- Forgetting step-by-step processes I had figured out

I needed a personal vault - a single place to store, categorize, and quickly retrieve this knowledge.

## The Solution

Built entirely within **Google AI Studio** using Gemini, this application provides:

1. **Prompts Manager** - Save and categorize prompts by use case (Coding, Marketing, UI/UX, etc.)
2. **Assets Gallery** - Upload images with automatic AI analysis
3. **Frameworks Builder** - Document step-by-step processes
4. **Dashboard** - Quick access to everything with stats and recent items

## The Magic: AI-Powered Image Analysis

The standout feature is **Magic Analysis** - when you upload an image, Gemini 2.5 Flash automatically:
- Generates a professional title
- Writes a contextual description
- Suggests relevant tags
- Categorizes into the appropriate collection

This transforms image organization from a chore into a one-click operation.

## Built Different

Unlike my other projects built with Claude Code and traditional development workflows, this application was created entirely within Google AI Studio. It demonstrates:

- Rapid prototyping with AI assistance
- Firebase as a complete backend solution
- PWA capabilities for offline access
- Real-time data synchronization

## What's Next

The vault continues to evolve as I use it daily. Planned improvements include better mobile responsiveness, bulk operations, and potentially sharing capabilities for frameworks.
