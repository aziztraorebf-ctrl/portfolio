# MindScribe

A dual-mode voice application that transforms how you capture thoughts and craft prompts. Built entirely within Google AI Studio using Gemini Flash.

## The Problem

Traditional note-taking breaks flow. You think in spoken language, yet most tools force you to type. And crafting effective AI prompts? That requires iteration and refinement that interrupts creative momentum.

## The Solution

MindScribe offers two distinct modes for voice-powered productivity:

### Notes Mode
Record your thoughts, get instant AI transcription, and transform raw recordings into polished content. Choose from 5 different "polish" styles to match your intent - from formal business writing to creative poetry.

### Prompter Mode
Speak your prompt ideas naturally, then let Gemini optimize them. Choose between structured technical optimization or natural persona-preserving refinement.

## The Magic: Voice Enhancement Pipeline

What sets MindScribe apart is the seamless audio-to-polished-content pipeline:

1. **Record** - Speak naturally, watch the waveform visualize your words
2. **Transcribe** - Gemini Flash converts speech to text instantly
3. **Polish** - Choose your transformation style
4. **Enhance** - Get AI insights, summaries, and even auto-generated diagrams

## Built Different

Like Prompt & Process Vault, this was built within Google AI Studio - a rapid prototyping approach that's fundamentally different from traditional development. The focus is on AI capabilities first, with the UI serving those capabilities.

## Widget Mode

A hidden feature: append `?mode=widget` to the URL for a compact, floating-window interface. Perfect for quick prompt optimization without leaving your current workflow.
