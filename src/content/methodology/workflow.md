# Zero-Tolerance Engineering

A development methodology that prioritizes correctness, verification, and systematic rigor over speed.

## Core Principles

### 1. Documentation-First
Consult official documentation BEFORE writing any code involving external APIs or libraries. Context7 MCP = source of truth.

### 2. BUILD-TEST-VALIDATE Cycle
Continuous cycle with real data, not mocks for final validation.

### 3. Mandatory Checkpoints
No completion claims without evidence and verification.

### 4. Hostile Code Review
Before every commit, actively look for bugs rather than confirming it works.
